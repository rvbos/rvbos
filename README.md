:rocket: I am 3rd year student at SGH Warsaw. I have been passionate about technology in business and web development since 2022, and would like to develop professionally in this direction.

:rocket: My previous professional experience consists of: business consulting, sales (in a IT product company) and projects coordination. Now I would like to work on the more technical side.

:rocket: Here are some projects that most reflect my current technical skill level. Each project through the design somehow relates to astronomy or cycling, as these are my passions. I am currently diving deeper into React, I am working on my first project (to be released here soon).
          
:rocket: Technologies and tools I use:
